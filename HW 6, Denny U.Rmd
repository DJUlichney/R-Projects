All assignments and exams will be submitted through R Markdown Notebooks like
these. For **every** question, your task is to do two things:

1. Write **one line** of code in the answer box that outputs your answer to the
question at hand.

2. If you need more than one line of code to answer the question, put the other
lines of code in the "supporting work" box.


```{r, include = FALSE}
  # do not edit this block
  # note that the option include = FALSE hides this from your PDF output
cards <- 
  paste0(c("A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K"),
         rep(c("H", "C", "S", "D"), each = 13))
  # format of cards is: [value][suit], such as "3H" for 3 of hearts,
  # "7C" for 7 of clubs, "TD" for 10 of diamonds
```

## Problem 1
If you draw a five-card hand (without replacement) from a deck of cards, what is
the probability that the fourth card is a heart? (Note that the `cards` vector 
is available in the block above.)

### Supporting Work
```{r}
fourthheart <- function(){
  substr(sample(cards,5),2,2)[4]=="H"
}
```

### Answer
```{r}
mean(replicate(10000,fourthheart()))
```

(Correct answer: $1/4$, which hopefully makes intuitive sense.)

## Problem 2
In the game of Risk, a player may send their army to attack another army. The
attacking player can roll up to three dice and the defending player can roll up
to two. (For simplicity, we will consider the case where each player rolls the
maximum number of dice possible.)

When scoring a battle, the attacker's top die is compared against the defender's
top die, and the attacker's middle die is compared against the defender's lower
die. The attacker has an inherent advantage in that they may discard their
lowest roll; however, the defender is also given an advantage in that they win
the results of any ties. The player who loses a roll comparison must forfeit one
army from their territory.

As an example: if the attacker rolls $(3, 1, 6)$ and the defender rolls
$(5, 3)$, then the attacker's $6$ is compared to the defender's $5$ (result: 
defender loses one army), and the attacker's $3$ is compared to the defender's
$3$ (result: attacker loses one army, because defender wins ties). The net
result of every battle that occurs in this fashion is that the attacker will
lose 0, 1, or 2 armies. 

Write a function that simulates the number of armies **lost** by an attacker 
during a battle that takes place as described above; its output should be 0, 1, 
or 2. Then, use this function to simulate 10,000 battles and construct a 
histogram of the results.

### Supporting Work
```{r}
risk <- function(){
  A <- sort(sample(1:6,3,replace=T))[-1]
  D <- sort(sample(1:6,2,replace=T))
  sum((D[2] >= A[2]),(D[1] >= A[1]))
}
```

### Answer

```{r}
hist(replicate(10000,risk()),breaks=-0.5:2.5)
```

(Correct answer: a histogram with three bars that descend slightly from left to
right -- don't forget to adjust the `breaks`!)

---

## Problem 3

Reconsider the Risk setup from the previous problem. What is the expected
number of armies lost by the attacker?

### Supporting Work

```{r}
risk <- function(){
  A <- sort(sample(1:6,3,replace=T))[-1]
  D <- sort(sample(1:6,2,replace=T))
  sum((D[2] >= A[2]),(D[1] >= A[1]))
}
```

### Answer

```{r}
mean(replicate(10000,risk()))
```

(Correct answer: $2387/2592 \approx 0.9209$)

## Problem 4
The following code block will obtain the first 10,000 prime numbers from the
OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences). Run this block once to store
these numbers as the vector `primes` in your workspace.

```{r, include = FALSE}
primes <- read.table("https://oeis.org/A000040/b000040.txt", header = F,
                     sep = " ")[, 2]
```

What is the sum of all the prime numbers that are less than 100?

### Supporting Work
```{r}

```

### Answer
```{r}
sum(primes[primes < 100])
```

(Correct answer: $1,060$; answer to this one should exactly match)

---

## Problem 5
How many of the first 10,000 primes have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3?

### Supporting Work
```{r}

```

### Answer
```{r}
length(primes[primes%%3==1])
```

(Correct answer: $4,988$; answer to this one should exactly match)

--- 

## Problem 6
What is the sum of all the primes between 1000 and 2000 with a last digit of 1?

### Supporting Work
```{r}
sumprimes <- function(){
  tprimes <- primes[primes > 1000 & primes < 2000]
  sum(tprimes[tprimes%%10==1])
}
```

### Answer
```{r}
sumprimes()
```

(Correct answer: $48,503$; answer to this one should exactly match)

---

## Problem 7

The Supporting Work block contains a function that simulates rolling two dice
and taking their sum. This process is simulated 10,000 times and the results
are stored in the `dice_sum` vector.

What is the average of the entries in `dice_sum` that are at least 7?

### Supporting Work

```{r}
# leave the code below alone
# ========
sum_of_two <- function(){
  sum(sample(1:6, 2, replace = T))
}
set.seed(121212)
dice_sum <- replicate(10000, sum_of_two())
set.seed(NULL)
# ========
# leave the code above alone


```

### Answer

```{r}
mean(dice_sum[dice_sum >= 7])
```

(Correct answer: $8.6604$; answer to this one should exactly match up to a
rounding error)

## Self Assessment:

If this assignment is graded out of 10 points, how many points do you think you
should earn, **and why?**

<!-- type your response to the self assessment below this line -->
I believe that I should earn full credit because I put forth the effort
necessary to answer all questions correctly.
