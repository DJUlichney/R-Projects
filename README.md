Rather than being a single programming project, this repository contains assignments that I completed for a Probability and Statistics class using the R programming language.
Each assignment is broken down into individual problems, with my solutions being displayed under each one.
Additionally, these assignment documents contain some examples and instructions from the professor that taught the class, with my own work being found under each of the non-example problems.
