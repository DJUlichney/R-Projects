All assignments and exams will be submitted through R Markdown Notebooks like
these. For **every** question, your task is to do two things:

1. Write **one line** of code in the answer box that outputs your answer to the
question at hand.

2. If you need more than one line of code to answer the question, put the other
lines of code in the "supporting work" box.

## Problem 1
Suppose you roll two dice and take their sum. What is the probability that the
sum is 12, given that the sum is larger than 9?

### Supporting Work
```{r}
p1 <- function(){
  roll <- sample(1:6,2,replace=T)
  (sum(roll)==12)[sum(roll)>9]
}
```

### Answer
```{r}
mean(unlist(replicate(10000,p1())))
```

(Correct answer: $1/6 \approx 0.1667$)

## Problem 2
Suppose you roll two dice and take their sum. What is the probability that the
sum is 9 or higher, given that at least one of the dice is odd?

### Supporting Work

```{r}
p2 <- function(){
  roll <- sample(1:6,2,replace=T)
  (sum(roll)>=9)[any(roll%%2==1)]
}
```

### Answer

```{r}
mean(unlist(replicate(10000,p2())))
```

(Correct answer: $7/27 \approx 0.2593$)

```{r, include = FALSE}
  # do not edit this block
  # note that the option include = FALSE hides this from your PDF output
cards <- 
  paste0(c("A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K"),
         rep(c("H", "C", "S", "D"), each = 13))
  # format of cards is: [value][suit], such as "3H" for 3 of hearts,
  # "7C" for 7 of clubs, "TD" for 10 of diamonds
```

## Problem 3

If you draw a five-card hand (without replacement) from a deck of cards, what is
the probability that the fourth card is a heart given that the first two cards
were *not* hearts? (Use the `cards` vector contained in the block above.)


### Supporting Work
```{r}
p3 <- function(){
  draw <- sample(cards,5)
  (substr(draw[4],2,2)=="H")[all(substr(draw[1:2],2,2)!="H")]
}
```

### Answer
```{r}
mean(unlist(replicate(1000,p3())))
```

(Correct answer: $13/50 = 0.26$)

---

## Problem 4
Suppose you roll five dice. What is the probability that their sum is at least
18, given that at least one of the dice is a six?

### Supporting Work

```{r}
p4 <- function(){
  roll <- sample(1:6,5,replace=T)
  (sum(roll)>=18)[any(roll==6)]
}
```

### Answer
```{r}
mean(unlist(replicate(10000,p4())))
```

(Correct answer: around $69\%$)

---

## Problem 5
Two people are playing a board game in which they must roll three dice. What is
the probability that they roll the same values, ignoring order but accounting
for repetitions? (That is, $(3, 5, 5)$ should be regarded as the same as 
$(5, 3, 5)$ but different from $(3, 3, 5)$.)

### Supporting Work
```{r}
p5 <- function(){
  p1 <- sample(1:6,3,replace=T)
  p2 <- sample(1:6,3,replace=T)
  identical(sort(p1),sort(p2))
}
```

### Answer
```{r}
mean(replicate(10000,p5()))
```

(Correct answer: around $2.1\%$ or $2.2\%$)

---

## Problem 6

Suppose you draw five cards. What is the probability that all are either hearts
or clubs? (Use the `cards` vector from above.)

### Supporting Work
```{r}
p6 <- function(){
  draw <- sample(cards,5)
  all(substr(draw,2,2)=="H" | substr(draw,2,2)=="C")
}
```

### Answer
```{r}
mean(replicate(10000,p6()))
```

(Correct answer: $253/9996 \approx 0.026$)

---

## Problem 7
Suppose you are drawing capital letters without replacement from a jar that
contains all 26 letters. What is the expected number of draws to collect every
vowel (A, E, I, O, U)?

### Supporting Work
```{r}
p7 <- function(){
  max(which(sample(LETTERS) %in% c("A","E","I","O","U")))
}
```

### Answer
```{r}
mean(replicate(10000,p7()))
```

(Correct answer: $22.5$)

## Self Assessment:

If this assignment is graded out of 10 points, how many points do you think you
should earn, **and why?**

<!-- type your response to the self assessment below this line -->
I believe that I should earn full credit because I put forth the effort necessary to fully complete the assignment.
